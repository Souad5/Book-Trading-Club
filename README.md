# 📚 **Book Trading Club**

### *Book Exchange & Reading Community Platform*

**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Book Trading Club** is a **community-driven web platform** designed to connect book lovers who want to **exchange, borrow, or donate books** — without monetary transactions.
Built using **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, the platform encourages sustainable reading habits and strengthens local reading communities.

This system promotes **collaboration over commerce**, creating a digital space where readers can **share their favorite books**, **discover new titles**, and **connect with like-minded readers** through reviews, discussions, and personalized recommendations.

## 💡 **Abstraction**

Instead of buying or selling books, users can **trade or lend books** within their community.
The app simplifies this process through:

* A **smart recommendation engine**
* **Verified user profiles**
* **Direct messaging** to coordinate exchanges safely

It’s more than just a website — it’s a **reading ecosystem** built around **trust**, **community engagement**, and **sustainability**.
